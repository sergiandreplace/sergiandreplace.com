While finishing the next article on the Flutter-planets series, I've decided to create a repository to sync branches with articles

<!--more--> 

You can find it on my Github project [flutter_planets_tutorial](https://github.com/sergiandreplace/flutter_planets_tutorial).

I'll be doing a branch per article, so if you click on the branch dropdown in Github you will see two entries (first and second part) other than master.

I have another repository named [planets_flutter](https://github.com/sergiandreplace/planets-flutter) that I use as my dev repository, but commits are not sync with the articles and the content is not exactly the same, as I use it for experiments and tests before writing an article. Anyways, you can check it if you want to see where are we going.

The third part is coming soon, stay tuned!
